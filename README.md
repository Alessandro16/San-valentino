# Will U Be My Valentine? 💖

A small interactive project created with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to make a Valentine's proposal in an original and funny way.

## ✨ Features
* **Elusive "No" Button**: Using JavaScript, the "No" button detects mouse movement (or touch) and randomly changes its position within the card, making it nearly impossible to click.
* **Dynamic Growth**: Every time the user tries to click "No", the "Yes" button increases in size, making it the only "logical" choice... obviously!
* **Responsive Design**: The card automatically adapts to both PC and Smartphone screens.
* **Final Surprise**: Once "Yes" is clicked, the button container disappears to reveal a celebratory confirmation image.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 / CSS3** (Flexbox & Responsive Design)
* **JavaScript** (DOM Manipulation & Event Listeners)
* **GitHub Pages** (Hosting)
